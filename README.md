# HourlyDAYPlanner 
A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 
This is powered by JQuery and will update CSS and HTML files

Time slots on this Hourly Day Planner will include the following:

* The time
* A field to hold user input
* A save button

The Save button will them sstore data (text and time) in LocalStorage
Hours are color coded based on past/present/future 


Using [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. 

#Project Minimum Requirements (for my info)

* Functional, deployed application.
* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing project.
* The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).
* Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.
* Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.
* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
